# townGen
A simple, open source, Town generator DM tool.

Ever have your adventurers stummble upon a hamlet and ask you, okay what the fuck is here? 
Then you furiously flip through your notes looking for the village your wrote only to find NOTHING?

never fear, town gen is here. Capable of quickly rattling off a town or even city with level appropriate gear 
to keep even your most obnoxious group members busy for whole moments! 
As one player dominates dm time rping a far too talkative clown's every fucking gesture, the others can browse the wares of several merchants!
